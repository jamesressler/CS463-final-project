# About the Project

This is the final project for the CS463 Intro to Web Development course at Portland State University. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to use technologies learned in class to build and deploy a basic personal biography website. Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, and Bootstrap, this site highlights some of my personal and professional accomplishments.

# Running the site

Currently, the site is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can find it at the link above. Alternatively, you can clone this repository and open the `html/index.html` file with the [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to host and view the website locally. If running it locally, you will need to run `npm i` from the project directory.

# Learning Materials

To create this site, I referenced the following materials:

- course materials, including the lecture, web examples, course homework, and textbook
- The [Mozilla Resources for Developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/) for learning how to use CSS grid and flexbox
- [Bootstrap docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) for how to use Bootstrap
